More features are coming, but I'd like to get some input on usage first. You can leave feedback on http://holtane.no/en/wp-nextgenmanager-2/ or mail me at lars-erik@holtane.no. I will try to answer questions fairly quickly.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-nexgenmanager` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Do not change the folder name, or the NggManager on your phone wil not detect the plugin.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Download NggManager to your android phone and add the site (full url: http://example.com/)

There is no actual wordpress output, so the screenshots are from the android client, NggManager, which is the frontend for the plugin.
